# Civ-FE

## Overview
Civ-FE is the frontend side of CivKit, a TypeScript full-stack development framework for professionals.

Civ-FE aims to tackle some of the structural deficiency of the Frontend industry as we know it in 2014-2025, filling the gap between "frontend" and general software engineering.

Web frontend developers had been mostly ignorant in terms of careful reference managing, and always repeatedly generate similar but new objects of specific structure. This is the root cause of frontend performance issue and twisted mindset.
Same happens to the lack of understanding of OOP, a cornerstone of software engineering, causing major deficiency in code structure and maintainability.

Civ-FE is designed to address these issues, and provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Design Focus
- OOP
- Careful, responsible reference and data management without using external libraries
- Decorators & Dependency Injection
- Adherence to web standards

## Philosophy
- Embrace web standards, not repelling them
- Embrace DOM, not pretending it doesn't exist
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OOP, not avoiding them
- Learn software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms, not running away from them
- Learn careful data management and reference keeping, not pinning on smart-ass libraries
- Learn to build scalable and maintainable applications. It's your responsibility, not the framework's

## Lessons learned from the past
Angular: over engineering, arbitrary use of rxjs, KPI centric, corporate bloat
React: mixing template and logic, readability nightmare, superficial "functional programming", Edo-Tensei of PHP
Vue: ignorance of engineering principles, brainless copycat, normalization of bad practices, marketing over substance

All of the above: repelling of DOM, undermining long term career development of frontend developers.

## Special tip on "utility-first" CSS
Tailwind CSS and other "utility-first" CSS frameworks are strongly discouraged.
Due to the fact that "utility-first" devastates readability and maintainability of templates.
This is another example of ignorance of web standards and software engineering principles in the frontend industry.
Careers of frontend developers are being undermined by such ideas.
